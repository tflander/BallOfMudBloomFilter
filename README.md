# BallOfMudBloomFilter

This is a refactoring kata

there are four projects:
  - BloomFilterDirty
  - BloomFilterDirtyTests
  - BloomFilterClean			
  - BloomFilterCleanTests

We only care about BloomFilterDirty and BloomFilterDirtyTests

The project BloomFilter clean is a possible refactoring solution.  It's actually the original code before making things bad.

TODO:

1) Run tests and verify they are all green
2) Clean up BloomFilterDirty
3) Make the hash algorithms injectable 

TODO:  Todd to provide requirements for step #3
